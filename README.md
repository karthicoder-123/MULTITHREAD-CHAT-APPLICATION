# Multithreaded Chat Application – Project Overview

# The Multithreaded Chat Application is a real-time messaging system designed to allow multiple users to communicate with each other simultaneously over a network. The core idea behind this application is to handle multiple clients concurrently using multithreading, ensuring that each user’s messages are received and broadcasted efficiently without interrupting the service for others.

# This type of application demonstrates how networking and concurrency can work together in a server-client architecture. It is an excellent project for understanding sockets, threads, message broadcasting, and synchronization between multiple users.
